## Social Interaction in VR

**improved technology:** realistic & interactive(expressive & responsive) *virtual characters*

**applications:** social anxiety psychotherapy, medical doctors training, autism neuroscience research

**What is VR?**

**Place illusion:** the illusion of being there - immersion (supported by VR hardware)

**Plausibility illusion:** the illusion of *events* in VR are real, and are are related to you personally (supported by software)

### Medical Doctors Trainings

**GP:** family doctor

**GP communication training:** avoiding anti-biotics overuse, child safeguarding concerns

#### Avoiding Anti-biotics Overuse

**superbugs:** anti-biotics have no effects, can only depend on the immune system

**doctor training:** refuse the prescription to fight against overuse of anti-biotics, feel stressful facing unreasonable patient demand for antibiotics

#### Child Safeguarding Concerns

**doctor training:** as a primary contact for families, GPs play a key role in raising safeguarding concerns; difficult in real life or with actors

**comments:** as a private tool and without being observed

**conclusions:**

- VR useful for research and training for medical doctor communications

- , Place illusions(IVR) and plausibility important for the skills learnt to be applicable in real-life scenarios

- Future work: autonomous agents

## AI in VR

**Machine Learning:** Content Generation, Embodied Interaction, Virtual Humans

**Content Generation:** AI can create VR: Objects, Places, Characters

**Embodied Interaction:** AI can let us interact with VR using our bodies

**Virtual Humans:** AI can make VR characters feel real(learn how real people interact with each other, gestures)

## ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory

presence: a user's sense of being there in an environment represented through media

**Physical space:**

- Sense of being there

- Sense of a surrounding and multi-sensory environment

- Sense of interaction (e.g. control, manipulation, behavioural responding)

**Engagement:**

- Enjoyment/Interest

- Involvement

- Intensity of experience/Emotion

- Attention

**Ecological validity:**

- Natural and real

- Believable

- Solid environment

**Negative effects:**

- Adverse physiological reactions(e.g. headache, eyestrain)

**Engagement & Impact:**

- Audience Quality of Experience

- Audience Attitudes(content & tech)

- Creator's Intended Impacts

- Audience Characteristics

- Interaction Affordances

- Economic Impacts

- Audience Behaviours

- Audience Traits(immersive tendencies)

- Stakeholder Target Impacts
